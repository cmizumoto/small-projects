# Small Projects

This is a series of small projects using HTML, CSS and JS. Most of the projects do not use libraries, if it is used is mostly Font Awesome for icons and small libraries for other styles. I'm using these projects to test my skills and knowledge.
Mostly small components, image slide shows, small games, fetching from APIs.
Also uploading them in netlify.
